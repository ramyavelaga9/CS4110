In  this experiment  designed a set of memory modules which will be used to design computer
system. All the memory are word-addressable ie each word is assigned a unique memory address where
a word length is 16 bit

In all the above memory modules RAMn means a random access memory with n Ã— 16 size where
n indicates the number of memory locations and 16 indicate that each location is of size 16 bit. In
such memory system the total number of address line (address bus) would be dlog 2 ne and the size
of data bus would be 16. The K here can be interpreted as 2 10 .

generatecmp.py generates .cmp and .tst files given value of n as command line argument
